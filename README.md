# Reflection Agent

**Reflection Agent** is a Python application designed to assist Twitter influencers by generating and refining high-quality tweets. It leverages LangChain and OpenAI's API to generate and critique tweets, providing detailed feedback to enhance virality, style, and overall impact.

## Features to review

- **Tweet Generation**: Automatically generates high-quality tweets based on user input, focusing on tech-related content.
- **Tweet Reflection**: Critiques and provides detailed recommendations for improving user-generated tweets.
- **Conditional Tweet Enhancement**: Iteratively improves tweets until a specified threshold is reached.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for package management

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nealbffl/reflection-agent.git
   cd reflection-agent
   ```

2. Install dependencies using Poetry:
   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your OpenAI API key:
   ```plaintext
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:
   ```bash
   poetry shell
   ```

## Usage

Run the `main.py` script to start the Reflection Agent:

```bash
python main.py
```

### Example

When prompted, the agent will ask for a tweet input. For example:

```plaintext
Make this tweet better:
@langChainAI - newly Tool Calling feature is seriously underrated. After a long wait, it's finally here - making the implementation of the tool easier than ever. Made a video covering their newest feature, check it out! #langchain #toolcalling #newfeature
```

The agent will generate a series of refined tweets, critiquing and improving upon each iteration until it meets the desired quality.

## How It Works

The core logic is implemented in two main files:

- **chains.py**: Defines the prompts used by the Reflection Agent for generating and critiquing tweets. The `generation_chain` is responsible for creating tweets, while the `reflection_chain` provides feedback for improvement.
  
- **main.py**: Manages the flow of tweet generation and reflection. It builds a graph of tweet states, iteratively generating and refining tweets based on the user's input.

The application uses a graph-based structure (`MessageGraph`) to control the sequence of operations, allowing for conditional logic to determine when the refinement process should stop.

## Dependencies

This project relies on the following key Python packages:

- **langchain**: Framework for building LLM-powered applications.
- **langchain-openai**: Integration of OpenAI's LLMs with LangChain.
- **langgraph**: A graph-based structure to manage message sequences.
- **python-dotenv**: For loading environment variables from a `.env` file.
- **black** and **isort**: For code formatting and style consistency.
